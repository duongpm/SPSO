This is the source code for the algorithm **Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO)**. The current implementation is for path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, it can be modified to apply to other path planning and optimization problems. Details of this algorithm can be found in the paper:

The paper was awarded [2023 Best Paper Award of the Applied Soft Computing journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-soft-computing/about/awards). Link to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107376 and its preprint https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10033

To run the program, download all the source files and run "SPSO_MAIN.m" in MATLAB. The program may require installing the Curve Fitting Toolbox depending on your MATLAB version.

_Update_: Another path planning algorithm that includes **kinematic constraints** of the UAV using Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization can be found here: https://github.com/ngandng/NMOPSO

Details of the algorithm are described in the paper: Thi Thuy Ngan Duong, Duy-Nam Bui, [Manh Duong Phung](https://sites.google.com/view/manhduongphung/), [*"Navigation variable-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization for UAV path planning with kinematic constraints"*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-024-10945-1), Journal of Neural Computing and Applications, 2025.

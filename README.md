This is the source code for the algorithm **Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO)**. The current implementation is for path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, it can be modified to apply to other path planning and optimization problems. Details of this algorithm can be found in the paper:

The paper was awarded [2023 Best Paper Award of the Applied Soft Computing journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-soft-computing/about/awards). Link to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107376 and its preprint https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10033

To run the program, download all the source files and run "SPSO_MAIN.m" in MATLAB.

Note: The program requires the Curve Fitting Toolbox to be installed.
Update: Another path planning algorithm considering kinematic constraints of the UAV using Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimation can be found here: https://github.com/ngandng/NMOPSO

This is the source code for the algorithm **Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO)**. The current implementation is for path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, it can be modified to apply to other optimization problems. Details of this algorithm can be found in the paper:
[Manh Duong Phung](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~duongpm/), [Quang Phuc Ha](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/quang.ha), [*"Safety-enhanced UAV Path Planning with Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimization"*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107376), Journal of Applied soft computing, vol. 107, pp. 107376, 2021. Link to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107376

To run the program, download all the source files and run "SPSO_MAIN.m" in MATLAB.

Note: The program requires the Curve Fitting Toolbox to be installed.

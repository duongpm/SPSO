This is the source code for the algorithm **Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO)**. The current implementation is for path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, it can be modified to apply to other path planning and optimization problems. Details of this algorithm can be found in the paper:
